# Puppy Adoption - Jetpack Compose app
![Workflow result](https://github.com/linean/puppy-adoption-app/workflows/Check/badge.svg)

## :scroll: Description
An example application that checks the capabilities of the Jetpack Compose framework.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
Jetpack Compose has reached beta, so it's a great time to check what possibilities it offers.
At first glance, displaying lists has been greatly simplified. 
Finally you do not have to work with XMLs! :tada:
